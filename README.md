The business problem for this exploratory data analysis project is to examine my personal expenses on my credit card.

# The Data:

The data derives from my personal credit card statements from May 2022 to November 2022. Features list transaction information to include transaction dates and names, posting dates and names, type, amount, and transaction points (travel reward points garnered from each transaction). PositiveAmount column was created to convert all Amounts to positive numbers to ascertain the sum of the transactions that occurred. No refunds happened during the period - so no positive amounts were in the Amount column.  

Evaluation:

The Word Cloud image was the most visually striking representation of my habits during this period. Kroger, Jersey Mike's, Amazon, Fiverr, and Amzn mktp (Amazon) ranked in the top five. Expenses rose during July, August and September. Mean amount spent was $85. 


# Future Goals: 

Keep tracking expenses over all accounts.
